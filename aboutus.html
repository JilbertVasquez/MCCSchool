                        The Mandaue City College (MCC) is a government-recognized higher education institution in 
                        Mandaue, Philippines, established for deserving students, mostly graduates from barangay high 
                        schools, who have no access to education in mainstream private colleges or universities. The school 
                        was established by the Local Government of Mandaue on September 27, 2005. There is another school 
                        with duplicate name called Mandaue City College but is now known as Paulus Cañete College (MCC Basak), 
                        but it is not affiliated with this school. Mandaue City College is still using the manual process of 
                        enrollment and they notice that the use of manual process of enrollment in the institution gives them 
                        difficulties like incomplete information that student fill up the registration form, unsecured storage
                         of records of the students and the time they consumed in the 9 processing of enrollment. As researchers,
                          this needs to have a solution to overpass this kind of difficulties during enrollment period in the school.

                        So as a solution to the problem stated, a computerized enrollment system can decrement the problems in managing 
                        the student's information, security of storage’s, and the time will take in processing an enrollment. 
                        The Computerized enrollment System can easily manage student’s information; minimize time consumption and can 
                        store all the records of the student in a secured storage.
